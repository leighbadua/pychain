# Pychain Ledger
This prototype demonstrates the usage of blockchain-based ledger system. It is complimented with the a user-friendly web interface through the use of Streamlit. This ledger would allow partner banks to conduct financial transactions (to transfer money between sends and receivers) and to verify the integrity of the data in the ledger. 

### Technologies
This project uses the following libraries and dependencies:
+ [**Anaconda**](https://docs.anaconda.com/): an open source package and environment management system.
+ [**Pandas**](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/getting_started/index.html): (included in Anaconda) a Python package data analysis toolkit.
+ [**Python**](https://www.python.org/): is a programming language that offers a vast modules and libraries such as dataclass, typing, hashlib, datetime, and much more.
+ [**Streamlit**](https://docs.streamlit.io/library/get-started): 


## Installation Guide

Activate your working environment and run the following command in your terminal:

```
pip install streamlit
```

## Usage 
Option 1:
1. Click on the link to directly use the Streamlit web interface https://share.streamlit.io/leighbadua/pychain/main/pychain.py

    **OR**

2. Activate your local working environment
3. Clone the repository `https://github.com/leighbadua/pychain.git`
4. From the repo launch `pychain.py` by typing the following into the terminal, `streamlit run pychain.py`
